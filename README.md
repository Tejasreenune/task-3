# ðŸ“Š Task 3: Retail Sales Dashboard â€“ Data Analyst Internship

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Design an interactive dashboard in Power BI to help business stakeholders gain insights into sales, profit, and growth using a sales-financial dataset.

## ðŸ§° Tools Used

- Formatted data types correctly (Date, Number, Text)
- Created a calculated `Total` column: `Quantity * Price`
- Created a new column `Age Group` based on age using conditional logic
- Handled missing values and outliers

## ðŸ§® DAX Measures Used
```DAX
Total Sales = SUM(retail_sales_dataset[Total])
Average Sales = AVERAGE(retail_sales_dataset[Total])

Customer Count = DISTINCTCOUNT(retail_sales_dataset[Customer ID])
```

## ðŸ“Š Visualizations Created
- **KPI Cards**: Total Sales, Average Sales, Quantity, Customer Count
